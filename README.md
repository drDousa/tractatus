# tractatus
To support our research of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, this site combines the German text with some views on it.  The text can be seen as a sequence of theses or as a searchable object. Given its numbering it can also be seen as a tree with, e.g., 1 parent of 1.1 and 1.2, and 1.21 child of 1.2, etc.  At the top of this page are functions for the different views. They speak for themselves, but a help-button provides some extras. On a desktop the function of a button is shown once the cursor moves over it.  Tractatus.nl is a bit responsive and should be suitable for several devices. Your desktop suits landscapes, your device may well prefer portrait.
