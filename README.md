# tractatus
To support our research of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, the file prosted here are of a website that combines the German text with some views on it; cf. www.tractatus.nl. I've posted this material on gitHub, as I intend to improve and extend the site.
At the website, the text of LPA can be seen as a tree with, e.g., 1 parent of 1.1 and 1.2, and 1.21 child of 1.2, etc, as a sequence of theses or as a searchable object. At the top of the webpage are functions for the different views. They speak for themselves, but a help-button provides some extras. On a desktop the function of a button is shown once the cursor moves over it.
Tractatus.nl is a bit responsive and should be suitable for several devices. Your desktop would prefer landscapes, other devices may well prefer portraits.
